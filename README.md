### Dependencies

* Golang 1.6
* PostgreSQL 9.5 with PostGIS extension
* Redis
* libsodium, zeromq and czmq if using ZeroMQ as a plugin transport

If using Mac OS X, you can get the ZeroMQ dependencies using Homebrew:

```

### Building from source

```shell
$ go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
$ make vendor
$ # export WITH_ZMQ=1 # If you need ZeroMQ support
$ make build
```

### Testing

1. Create a PostgreSQL database called `skygear_test` with PostGIS enabled:

```shell
psql -h db -c 'CREATE DATABASE skygear_test;' -U postgres
psql -h db -c 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis;' -U postgres -d skygear_test
psql -h db -c 'CREATE EXTENSION citext;' -U postgres -d skygear_test
```

2. Test case assume the 127.0.0.1 have access to `skygear_test`, add the
following to `pg_hba.conf`:

```
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
```
