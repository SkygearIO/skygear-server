## Version number

Version number conforms to `x.y.z` format. For each release cycle, `y`
is incremented by 1. The same `x.y` corresponds to the tag of skygear and it
will stay the same for all above modules during the release cycle.
For hot fix within a release cycle, increment `z`
by 1 and `z` is reset to 0 on the next release cycle.
